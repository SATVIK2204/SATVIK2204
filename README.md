<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Satvik</h1>

I am a 4th year,Computer Science undergraduate with interest in problem solving and learning new technologies. 

As of now, I have done a internship at Lawnics Technologies, where we worked on data extraction and cleaning. I have made multiple projects using classical ML Algorithms as well as with the help of Deep Learning. I am constantly learning new thing and expanding my skill set. I am currently expanding my tech stack to Web Development and currently learning Backned fundamentals.

So, if you have some data and don't know what to do with it, let me have a look over it. I might make something that can help your organization grow.
Also, I am open to work. So, if you are hiring let's connect.
